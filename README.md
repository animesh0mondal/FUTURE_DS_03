# Student Satisfaction Survey Analysis
This notebook performs a sentiment analysis on a student satisfaction survey dataset.

## Data Loading and Cleaning
The notebook starts by loading the data from a CSV file and performing basic data cleaning steps, including dropping irrelevant columns and standardizing text data.

## Sentiment Analysis
The TextBlob library is used to perform sentiment analysis on the survey questions, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Analysis and Visualization
The notebook analyzes the distribution of sentiment and visualizes it using a bar plot. It also explores the average percentage scores for each sentiment category and the sentiment distribution across different courses.

## Key Findings
* The majority of feedback is neutral, followed by positive and then negative.
* The average percentage scores are relatively similar across all sentiment categories.
* The distribution of sentiment is consistent across different courses.
